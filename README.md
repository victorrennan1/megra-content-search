# The Competitor Dashboard — full setup guide

This is the system from the reel: every morning it can rebuild a dashboard of your competitors' latest reels — who's posting, which hooks are pulling views, the full script of every reel broken into Hook / Beats / CTA — so you review your niche in about three minutes instead of scrolling for hours.

You're getting the whole thing:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `00-README.md` | This guide — start here |
| `scrape.py` | The scraper — pulls competitor reels + transcribes them (the only code you run) |
| `ANALYZE.md` | The analysis playbook Claude follows to score + break down every reel |
| `DASHBOARD-SPEC.md` | The spec Claude follows to build your dashboard.html |
| `competitor-accounts.md` | Your competitor list — a template to fill in |

**You don't need to be able to code.** The fastest path is to hand this whole pack to Claude and let it do the setup.

## The 5-minute version (recommended)

1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) if you don't have it.
2. Make a folder (e.g. `competitor-dashboard/`) and save all five files into it.
3. Open Claude Code in that folder and say:

> Read 00-README.md and set this competitor dashboard up for me. My niche is **[what you make content about, and for whom]**. My competitors are **[3–7 Instagram handles]**. Walk me through getting the two API keys, then do the rest yourself.

Claude will take it from there — including editing the niche line in `ANALYZE.md` and filling `competitor-accounts.md` for you.

## What it costs to run

- **Apify** (does the Instagram scraping) — this is the main cost. A few dollars a month at 3 reels per account, a handful of accounts, run a few times a week. New accounts get free monthly credit, which covers a lot of it.
- **ElevenLabs Scribe** (transcription) — pennies per batch. Free tier usually covers it.
- **The analysis is free** — Claude does the scoring, breakdowns, and dashboard in your normal session. No OpenAI key, no extra subscription.

Realistic total: **about $5/month.**

## The two keys you need

1. **Apify** — sign up at [apify.com](https://apify.com) → Settings → Integrations → copy your API token.
2. **ElevenLabs** — sign up at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) → your profile → API keys → create one.

Then set them in your terminal (Claude can put these in your shell profile so it's permanent):

```bash
export APIFY_TOKEN="your-apify-token"
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-elevenlabs-key"
```

## Manual setup (if you'd rather drive)

1. Fill in `competitor-accounts.md` — one row per competitor, `Active = yes` for the ones to track.
2. Open `ANALYZE.md` and replace the **YOUR NICHE** line at the top with what you actually make content about.
3. Run the scraper (needs Python 3.10+ and the `requests` package — `pip install requests`):

```bash
python3 scrape.py               # 3 latest reels per active account
python3 scrape.py --limit 5     # or 5 per account
python3 scrape.py --balance     # check your Apify spend/credit first
```

4. Tell Claude: **"Process the latest batch in staging/ following ANALYZE.md."** It scores every reel for relevance to your niche, splits the transcript into Hook / Beats / CTA, and writes one note per keeper into `notes/`.
5. Tell Claude: **"Build the dashboard following DASHBOARD-SPEC.md."** You get a `dashboard.html` — open it in your browser.
6. Repeat whenever you want fresh data: scrape → "process the batch" → "rebuild the dashboard". The scraper remembers what it's already seen, so you only ever pay for new reels.

## The weekly rhythm

Run it once or twice a week. Open the dashboard, read the top hooks and the taxonomy (which hook styles keep winning in your niche), pick your angles. That's the whole point: **you stop watching reels and start watching patterns.**

Want it to actually run every morning, hands-off? Ask Claude to schedule `scrape.py` for you (launchd/cron on Mac, Task Scheduler on Windows). Out of the box it's run-when-you-want — which is honestly enough.

## Fair-use notes (read this once)

- This is **research signal**, not a content-theft kit. You're studying what works — hooks, structures, topics — not republishing anyone's reels. Don't repost the videos or transcripts.
- Use your own Apify account and keep the volume reasonable (the defaults are). Scraping public Instagram data sits in a gray area of Instagram's terms — the same gray area every analytics tool lives in — but it's your account and your call.
- The downloaded videos in `staging/videos/` are working files for transcription. Delete them after a batch is processed; the transcripts stay in your notes.

## Troubleshooting

- **"APIFY_TOKEN not set"** — the export lines above aren't in your current terminal. Re-run them (or ask Claude to add them to your shell profile).
- **Scrape returns 0 items** — check the handles in `competitor-accounts.md` are exact Instagram usernames (no `@`), and marked `Active = yes`.
- **A transcript comes back empty** — some reels are music-only. They still stage; Claude scores them from the caption.
- Anything else: paste the error into Claude. It has all five files — it can fix its own plumbing.
